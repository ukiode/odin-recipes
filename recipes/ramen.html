    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Sauté Vegetables:</b> Add the sesame oil into a large pot and heat over medium heat. Add in the garlic and ginger and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add in the sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-5 minutes or until softened.</li>
            <li><b>Add Liquids:</b> Pour in the chicken stock, water, and soy sauce.</li>
            <li><b>Simmer:</b> Then bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Cook Bokchoy:</b> Add the bokchoy and then simmer for an additional 2 minutes to soften the leaves.</li>
            <li><b>Add Noodles:</b> Remove the pot from the heat. Then place the ramen noodles in the hot pot of broth. Allow the noodles to sit for ONLY a couple of minutes until they loosen and soften up. The noodles will soften quickly, so this should be done right before serving. </li>
            <li><b>Transfer to Serving Bowls:</b> Divide the ramen, veggies, and broth evenly into bowls.</li>
            <li><b>Add Toppings:</b> Top the ramen with sliced grilled chicken and soft boiled eggs. Then garnish with toppings of choice and enjoy!</li>
