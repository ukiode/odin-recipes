    <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are thousands of chocolate chip cookies recipes out there. Everyone has their favorite and this one is mine. Just a glance at the hundreds of reviews in the comments section tells me that this recipe is a favorite for many others too! In fact, if you asked me which recipe to keep in your apron pocket, my answer would be this one. These cookies are loved… and, warning: they disappear FAST.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Melted Butter</li>
            <li>Brown and White Sugar</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Baking Soda</li>
            <li>Egg and Egg Yolk</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Chill the dough:</b> Chilling the cookie dough is so important in this recipe! Unless you want the cookies to spread into a massive cookie puddle, chilling the dough is mandatory here. It allows the ingredients to settle together after the mixing stage but most importantly: cold dough results in thicker cookies. Cover the cookie dough and chill for at least 2–3 hours and even up to 3–4 days.</li>
            <li><b>Roll the cookie dough balls extra tall:</b> After the dough has chilled, scoop out a ball of dough that’s 3 Tablespoons for XL cookies or about 2 heaping Tablespoons (1.75 ounces or 50g) for medium/large cookies. I usually use this medium cookie scoop and make it a heaping scoop. But making the cookie dough balls tall and textured, rather than wide and smooth, is my tried-and-true trick that results in thick and textured-looking cookies. We’re talking thick bakery-style cookies with wrinkly, textured tops. Your cookie dough should look less like balls and more like, well, lumpy columns, LOL.</li>
